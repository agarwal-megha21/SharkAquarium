# SharkAquarium


## About Project
A crowdfunded business support platform, wherein, the entrepreneur can submit their business ideas on the platform. The investor can review the pitches, invest in them, and can get a return as a percentage of the ventureâ€™s equity. At a later point, the investor can sell the stocks owned on the platform itself as well as invest in equity of other ventures too. This contributes to the functioning of a stock exchange platform. 

* Entrepreneurs: When the entrepreneurs log in to their account, they will be able to add their pitches for the investors to view and invest. They can also keep track of the amount already invested in their pitch. 

* Investors: When the investors log in to their account, they will be able to review the pitches posted by the entrepreneurs on the pitch aquascape page. If they are willing to fund any, they can contribute the required amount to the entrepreneurs in return for a certain portion of the equity. They can fund multiple pitches. They can also trade their share of equity or buy more on the plaform's stock exchange.
