## About Project
     The entrepreneur can submit their business ideas on the platform. The investor can review the pitches, invest in them, 
     and can get a return as a percentage of the ventureâ€™s equity. At a later point, the investor can sell the stocks owned, 
     on the platform itself; as well as invest in equity of other ventures too. This contributes to the functioning of a 
     stock exchange platform. 

     * Entrepreneurs:
         When the entrepreneurs log in to their account, they will be able to add their pitches for the investors to view. 
         On the website, there will be a feature where entrepreneurs and investors can work out the deal. Also, if they 
         are interested in presenting their pitch to any specific investor. 

      * Investors:
         When the investors log in to their account, they will be able to review the pitches posted by the entrepreneurs on 
         the pitch-seabed/ aquascape page. If they are willing to fund any, they can contribute the required amount to the 
         entrepreneurs. In a case where they accept the pitch, the investor will benefit from the entitlement of equity. 
         They can repeat this process to fund multiple pitches. They are free to sell the stocks on the stock exchange 
         platform at a later point in time if they wish to do so.
