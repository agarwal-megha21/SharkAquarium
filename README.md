## About Project
     A crowdfunded business support platform, wherein, the entrepreneur can submit 
     their business ideas on the platform. The investor can review the pitches,
     invest in them, and can get a return as a percentage of the ventureâ€™s equity. 
     At a later point, the investor can sell the stocks owned, on the platform itself;
     as well as invest in equity of other ventures too. 
     This contributes to the functioning of a stock exchange platform. 

     * Entrepreneurs:
         When the entrepreneurs log in to their account, they will be able to add 
         their pitches for the investors to view. They can also keep track of the 
         number of pitches already invested. 

      * Investors:
         When the investors log in to their account, they will be able to review the
         pitches posted by the entrepreneurs on the pitch-seabed/ aquascape page.
         If they are willing to fund any, they can contribute the required amount to the 
         entrepreneurs. In a case where they accept the pitch, the investor will benefit 
         from the entitlement of equity. They can fund multiple pitches. Also, they are 
         free to trade their stocks on the stock exchange platform at a later point in time.
